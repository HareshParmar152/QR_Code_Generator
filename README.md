# QR Code Generator
Generate QR codes quickly and easily using this Python QR Code Generator. This project provides a simple command-line interface (CLI) for creating QR codes from text, URLs, or other data. QR codes are widely used for encoding information that can be easily scanned and decoded by smartphones and other devices.

This QR Code Generator is built using the qrcode library in Python, making it a lightweight and efficient tool for creating QR codes for various purposes. Whether you need to share a link, encode contact information, or distribute other data, this tool simplifies the process of generating QR codes.

About QR Code Generator Project
QR Code is a machine-readable matrix barcode that uniquely represents information. With the increase in optical capabilities of smartphones, the use of QR codes started increasing.

In this project, we will build a QR Code generator using Python Modules.

Generate QR Code in Python
We will be using Tkinter and Qrcode modules in Python to build this project. We use the Tkinter module to build the GUI to take the following inputs:

   1. text/URL to convert to QR Code
   2. location to save the QR code with name
   3. size of the QR code.
Then we generate the QR code from the above inputs and save in the given location using the qrcode module.
